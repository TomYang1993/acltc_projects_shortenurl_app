# URL Shortener App

A URL Shortening solves the following problem: Imagine you have a url that you want to easily distribute (examples: on a physical paper flyer, or on Twitter) but the url is crazy long, as some urls tend to be. A URL Shortening service allows you to create a shortened url (e.g. http://mydomain.com/abcde) that when people visits it, they will be redirected to the real, longer url. This way you can simply distribute the short url, but people will end up at the right place. Another advantage of distributing shortened urls is that you can track how many people visited each one. This can be useful for marketing purposes. Imagine you have an advertisement on two different billboards, and you use a different shortened url on each. Now you can see how many people visited each url, and therefore learn which billboard is more effective.
